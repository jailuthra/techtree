Just run the script by typing `$ python make_graph.py`, to output the graph to `graph.svg`, and convert it to JSON to `graph.json`.
Then do `$ python -m http.server 8888`, and go to `http://localhost:8888` on your browser to view the graph.

It also generates a dot file `graph.dot`, which contains the graph information in a graphviz compatible format.
